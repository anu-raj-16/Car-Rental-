# Car Rental System

## Proposal

The application represents a **Car Rental System** in which the **manager** can keep track of the cars they have rented. My objective is to make it as close to the real world system as possible and in order to do so, I have decided to incorporate user data. The application will ask for the person's basic information such as, *name*, *age*, *driver's license number* and *expiration date* etc. It will also store basic information about the cars owned by the system such as *color*, *model*, *bodystyle*, *make*, *year* etc. 

As someone who is new to Canada, I am about to get my driver's license and I would like to be able to rent different types to cars to drive when I do turn of legal age (to rent a car - 21 years). This seems like an application that would be useful to others like me and that's why I wanted to build this app.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a car to my car rental with vehicle number, make, bodystyle, year.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the cars in my car rental.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a car as available for renting.
